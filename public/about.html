<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an enthusiastic and driven individual with a passion for learning and personal growth. My interests span across various fields, 
  including science, technology, and sports, which have shaped my multifaceted approach to life. Whether it’s solving complex problems in
  mathematics or diving deep into physics and biology to prepare for a future in medicine, I embrace challenges as opportunities to grow.
</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I am an active participant in extracurricular activities, especially taekwondo, where I have competed at 
  inter-university tournaments and worked closely with my team. I value teamwork, discipline, and resilience—qualities that taekwondo 
  has instilled in me. I also enjoy organizing and participating in events, as they allow me to connect with others and sharpen my leadership skills.

<p>I believe in balancing ambition with humility and community spirit. Whether it’s preparing speeches on pressing issues like the fossil fuel 
  crisis or exploring innovations in renewable energy, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the world. With a commitment to continuous improvement, 
  I strive to make the most of every opportunity while staying grounded in my values.
